        <h2 class="title content">Description</h2>
        <p>Frico, from the north of Italy, is the ultimate comfort food. 
            Potatoes and onions sauteed until soft then fried with lots of Italian Montasio cheese until its extra crispy on the outside but soft and gooey on the inside.
            Its the ultimate treat for colder weather</p>
        <h2 class="title content">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Montasio cheese </li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Butter and olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="title content">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small pan over a medium heat, once hot add the onions and saute them until soft and translucent </li>
            <li>Add the grated potato and season with a good pinch of salt. Cook for about 15 minutes on a medium heat until the potato is just cooked through. Toss and turn the potatoes every so often to ensure even cooking. I like to do this with two wooden spoons as if you're tossing a salad.</li>
            <li>Add 250g or 8.8oz of the cubed montasio cheese and mix for a couple of minutes until the cheese is combined and is starting to melt.</li>
            <li>Once the cheese has started to melt, spread the frico out into an even layer and leave it to cook on one side for about 6-7 mins until golden brown</li>
            <li>Once browned slide the frico onto a plate and then place the pan upside down on top of the plate and flip it back over into the pan to cook the other side</li>
        </ol>
